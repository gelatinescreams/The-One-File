# The One File - Network Topology Maker

In the end there can only be "The ONE File". A portable and completely self contained network topology builder. The canvas, the logic, the settings, your nodes, your connections, and your notes all live inside a single standalone HTML file. Any modern browser can open and edit it without any prior setup. (is the idea)
